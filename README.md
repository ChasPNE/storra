Storra
======

A simplistic storage server based on [node.js] (http://nodejs.org/). Currently only [nStore](https://github.com/creationix/nstore) can be used as the storage backend. Other storage backends might be possible in future versions.

Right now, this package basically wraps nStore in a RESTful http interface.
