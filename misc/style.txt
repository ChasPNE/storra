Storra Style Guide

(Mostly taken from http://nodeguide.com/style.html, Felix G.'s style guide)

Note: These "rules" have been written month after I started to code storra.
Right now, the storra code is quite inconsistend and *does not follow* this
style guide. Currently, it is a formulation of the goal, not of the status quo.

Production code: Plain old Javascript
Specs: Coffeescript
Indentation: Two spaces, no tabs
Semicolons: No, never (different from Felix')
  See https://npmjs.org/doc/coding-style.html#Semicolons for exceptions.
Line Length: 80
Quotes: single quotes
JSON quotes: double quotes
Quotes in coffee script files (specs): double quotes
Braces: ppening brace on same line
Functions: lower camel case
Variables: lower camel case
Class names: upper camel case
Constants: all upper case, with underscores
File Names: all lower case, snake case (different from Felix')
Equality: triple equality operator
Named Closures: Yes, please
Parameter Ordering: error, param, param, ..., callback, callback, ...
Function Style: Avoid nested closures/callbacks. Extract nested callbacks below
  the first level into separate, named functions. See http://caolanmcmahon.com/posts/nodejs_style_and_structure/,
  secion 2. "More, smaller functions"
Never use undefined. Pass null for optional function parameters, Do not just
  omit optional parameters, that is equivalent to passing undefined. (See
  https://npmjs.org/doc/coding-style.html#null-undefined-false-0)
Exceptions: Never throw anything. Pass an error object to the callback.
Always check for errors in callbacks.
