add queries
  how to query RESTful?
  unified query language for all backends or individual queries for each backend?
add "serious" backend
  mongoDB
  couchDB?
  riak?
  redis?
  MySQL, Oracle??, sqlite
drop nstore backend
use callback versions of node-dirty API everywhere
log asynchronously, use proper logging lib, don't pay for string concatenation if log level is not activated
configure per yaml instead of hacking index.js
  port
  bind address
  backend
get rid of fixed routing - collection/document to allow backends with a more nesting levels or which are not simple key-value document stores
  configure routing per yaml? let backend configure routing?
built-in multi-tenant-capabilities would be cool, maybe, or something like multiple virtual storra servers under one "physical" storra servers (each configured separately) - think shared storra hosting
