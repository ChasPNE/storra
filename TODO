add package.json
add queries
  how to query RESTful?
  unified query language for all backends or individual queries for each backend?
add "serious" backend
  mongoDB
  couchDB?
  riak?
cache open collections for nstore and node-dirty
configure per yaml instead of hacking index.js
  port
  bind address
  backend
get rid of fixed routing - collection/document to allow backends with a more nesting levels or which are not simple key-value document stores
  configure routing per yaml? let backend configure routing?
built-in multi-tenant-capabilities would be cool, maybe
