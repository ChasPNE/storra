== Storra Core Features ==
* Add more specs to spec/routing_integration.spec.coffee
* Use Error objects with errno or custom http_status_code attribute instead of throwing
strings, integers and whatnot. Check for all places where we throw an error or call a
callback with an err != null/undefined
* Convert all of our own node modules to standard javascript objects and put that into exports/modules.exports
* Use a dependency injection container
* Various improvements in MongoDB backend
* Queries
  - how to query RESTful?
  - unified query language for all backends or individual queries for each backend?
  - use MongoDB and CouchDB to validate the proof of concept - can we easily map the storra query language to both backends? Or, the other way round, are the query interfaces of both similar enough to guide the way to the unified NoSQL query API?
* -> GitHub
* Add more backends, a whole lot of them, one after another...
  - Caution: For hosted Storra, this is less important. The customer probably does not really care about the backend.
  - MongoDB: Done (well, sort of)
  - CouchDB?
  - Riak?
  - Redis?
  - Traditional SQL DBs?
    - MySQL
    - sqlite
    - Oracle??
* Get rid of fixed routing - collection/document to allow backends with a more nesting levels or which are not simple key-value document stores
* Use callback versions of node-dirty API everywhere
* log asynchronously, use proper logging lib, don't pay for string concatenation if log level is not activated
* Performance tests
  - Performance testing with different backends, without network latency, without concurrent requests
  - Load/throughput tests with a huge number of concurrent requests - choose a backend, which supports this scenario well. Second step: Execute these tests with different backends.
  - Performance tests including *local* network latency and with comparisons to accessing the DB directly
  - Performance tests for distributed scenario (Storra as a hosted service somewhere else) - conclusions?
  configure routing per yaml? let backend configure routing?
* Built-in multi-tenant-capabilities would be cool, maybe, or something like multiple virtual storra servers under one "physical" storra servers (each configured separately) - think shared storra hosting
* Push capabilities (push stuff to mobile phones when certain data is changed/added)

== Storra Infrastructure ==
* Requirements:
  - Load Balancing
  - Fail Over
  - Monitor/restart node processes
  - SSL
* Solutions
  - Look into node-supervisor and similar solutions
  - nginx before Storra?

== Storra Security ==
* Deny access everybody except users
* Enforce isolation of tenants
